# climateArchiv_AdvDatabase_Project

This is a project I chose to do for my Advanced Database course.
The general idea behind this system is that it should be able to take in data from weather stations, ofcourse the data it takes in is specific and can be seen in the uploaded report, it would be able to store all that data in a time-series database and a B+- tree would be used for indexing... Anyway read the uploaded documents to find out more.
Thank you:)
